# ASN Processing Tool

This script automates the process of extracting CIDR ranges, resolving IPs, and performing reverse DNS lookups for a given ASN. It also includes automated installation of required tools.

## Features
- Extract CIDR ranges using `whois` and `asnmap`.
- Expand CIDR ranges into individual IP addresses using `mapcidr`.
- Perform reverse DNS lookups to resolve associated domains using `dnsx`.
- Checks for open ports on All IPs  using `naabu`.
- Automatically install missing tools.
- Archive results for easier storage and sharing.
- Comprehensive logging for tracking progress.

## Tools Required
The script uses the following tools:
1. **whois**: For querying CIDR ranges from RADB.
2. **asnmap**: For extracting CIDR ranges associated with an ASN.
3. **mapcidr**: For expanding CIDRs into individual IPs.
4. **dnsx**: For reverse DNS lookups and domain resolution.
5. **naabu**: Checks for open ports on IPs from all_ip.txt.

## Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xPoyel/0x-asn-toolkit.git
cd 0x-asn-toolkit
```
### Step 2: Install Required Tools
The script will check and install missing tools automatically. Below are the manual installation commands for each tool:

Tools Install:
```bash
# Make it executable:
chmod +x install.sh

# Run the script:
./install.sh
```

Tools Install Check: 

```bash
# Make it executable:
chmod +x check.sh

# Run the script:
./check.sh
```

### Manually Install
- whois:
```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y whois
```
- asnmap:
```bash
  go install github.com/projectdiscovery/asnmap/cmd/asnmap@latest
```
- mapcidr:
```bash
  go install github.com/projectdiscovery/mapcidr/cmd/mapcidr@latest
```
- dnsx:
```bash
  go install github.com/projectdiscovery/dnsx/cmd/dnsx@latest
```
- naabu:
```bash
  go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/naabu/v2/cmd/naabu@latest
```

### Usage Instructions
1. Make the script executable:
```bash
  chmod +x 0x-asn-toolkit.sh
```
2. Run the script:
```bash
  ./asn_processor.sh <ASN>
```
- Replace <ASN> with the target ASN, e.g., AS12345.

3. Output Files:
- CIDR.txt: Combined list of CIDR ranges.
- all_ip.txt: All IP addresses from the CIDR ranges.
- ASN_domain.txt: Resolved domains from reverse DNS lookups.
- Archived Results: Results are saved as asn_results_<ASN>_<timestamp>.tar.gz
4. Logs: A detailed log file (asn_processing_<timestamp>.log) is created for each run.
### Example
```bash
./0x-asn-toolkit.sh AS12345
```
### Output:

- CIDR.txt
- all_ip.txt
- ASN_domain.txt
- port-open-list.txt
- Results archived to asn_results_AS12345_<timestamp>.tar.gz.
### Dependencies
Ensure the following are installed:
- Linux/Unix Shell
- Golang: For asnmap, mapcidr, naabu and dnsx
```bash
sudo apt install -y golang
```
